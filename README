# Weather-SMS
This program texts the user's phone the low and high temperatures that day based on
the user's schedule. Currently, the user's schedule starting and ending times are part
of the source code and known at runtime, as this program is designed to be run every
weekday at 6:00 AM using a cronjob. The program also tells the user if there is rain in
the forecast during the user's schedule.
